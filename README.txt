An interactive quiz game about space built for mobile phones. The website also serves as a template
for other quiz games. 

The game was built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and JQuery. I used HTML and CSS for basic structure and design.
JavaScript was used to handle user interaction and gameplay. Finally, JQuery was used for animations. I also used PhoneGap
to turn the website to Android Application and published it to Google Play Store, and it was downloaded over 2,000 times.
